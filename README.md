StereoView
==========
The whole solution is concerned about stereoview.
Daheng's video capture card is used to get binocular view pictures,
and Opencv library is used to help me to process stereo calibration and get 3D point cloud data.
So a wrapped class DahengVideoCapture is necessary for the OpenCV library to get binocular view mats.
The DahengVideoCapture class will has some member functions as the same with the OpenCV built-in class VideoCapture. 


It's the first time I use github.I wise to have a well sensation working with github.
